NCSA identified several dropped cases (95-72-601/603/613) which should not have been included in the final PCDS SAS file.  Additionally, one case (95-41-602) was inappropriately overwritten by another case's data.

The three dropped cases were removed from the data files, and the overwritten case was recoded based upon existing hard copy case materials.

The new versions of the analysis files were reposted to the FTP site on 05/02/2008.

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
